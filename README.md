# RoadLife

## Why
Have you ever wondered how far on average you've lived from a specific road? For some reason I have, well two roads really; the A6 and the A38. Both roads have featured quite heavily in my life and so one night i started to wonder "what is the average kms i have been from these roads over my entrie life?"

This initial thought resulted in me doing a bit of research into how this might be calculated and if i'd be able to generate a tool that might enable other people to calculate their distance. It seemed that a solution would be a Streamlit app using GeoPandas to caclculate distances. i had been looking for an excuse to learn both of these libraries so it felt like the perfect problem.
